🪴 Landscaping Services Webpage

A fully responsive multi-page website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.
This project is inspired by my previous work experience as a content writer at 411 Locals, where I wrote SEO-optimized content for small business websites — including service pages, About Us, and contact sections.

This webpage represents a fictitious landscaping business, featuring pages such as Home, About Us, Services, and Contact — all styled consistently to demonstrate layout, typography, and responsive design skills.
